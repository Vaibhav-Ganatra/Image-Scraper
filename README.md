# Image-Scraper

To setup this project on your local machine, you just need to create a python virtual environment and download the requirements from `requirements.txt`.

To create the virtual environment, you can use:
`mkvirtualenv venv`. If the environment is not activated, you can use the command `workon venv` to activate your virtual environment.

Then, install the requirements by executing: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This should install Selenium, and other requirements necessary for this project.

Once that is done, you have to specify the keyword and the limit at the end of the `scrape.py` file.
Then you can execute the script from the terminal using:

`python scrape.py`
